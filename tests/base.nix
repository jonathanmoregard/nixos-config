#   - home-manager activation completed for jonathan

#   - X server up (autoLogin path; catches LightDM regressions in
#     the lightest lane before they trip the heavier ones)
#   - kindle udev rule file present with the expected unset clauses
#     (vm-base-only by design: this is the lane that imports the full
#     dellan host config via mkTest, and we only need to verify the
#     payload once per build — mkMinimalTest / mkFeatureTest lanes
#     don't include kindle.nix)
